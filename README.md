# Data Warehouse Pro

Welcome to **Data Warehouse Pro**, a guide to mastering advanced concepts in data warehousing and SQL.

## What is a Data Warehouse?

A data warehouse is a centralized repository that stores structured data from multiple sources. It is designed for query and analysis rather than transaction processing.

## Why Learn Advanced SQL?

SQL (Structured Query Language) is the backbone of data warehousing. Mastering advanced SQL techniques allows you to:
- Optimize query performance.
- Handle complex data transformations.
- Build scalable and efficient data pipelines.

## Topics Covered

- **Data Modeling**: Star schema, snowflake schema, and normalization.
- **ETL Processes**: Extract, Transform, Load workflows.
- **Advanced SQL**: Window functions, CTEs, and query optimization.
- **Data Visualization**: Connecting warehouses to BI tools.

## Getting Started

1. Install a database system (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, or SQL Server).
2. Set up a sample data warehouse schema.
3. Practice SQL queries using real-world datasets.
